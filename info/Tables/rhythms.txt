// an llll of non-zero rational numbers for each element, optionally including rhythmic tree levels   
required: (rat|rat[]|rat[][]|rat[][][]...)[]

// an llll of velocities [1 - 127], each element can be a list or an int.
// if optional is NOT provided, all velocities are assumed to be nil for rest elements and 100 otherwise
optional: (int|int[])[]
// An int will set all notes in a chord to that velocity, a list will set as many as it has, and set any 
// extra notes to the last velocity provided, or ignore any extra velocities.

// a depth-2 llll of bools, determining if a note of a chord is tied to the next note at that voice
ties: (int|int[])[]
// a single value is spread across all notes in a chord 
// nil values are set to 0, unless the pitch value is already also nil

// scale is an llll of prime-count vectors
scale: int[][] 
// a unique set of values, where each value is a n-vector of signed integers, where the product of 
// the nth prime to the power of the nth entry for all primes from 1 to n is a unique rational number present 
// in the durations list. 

// contour is an llll of positive integers pairs
contour: [int,int][]
// the first integer refers to the index of an element in scale
// the second refers to how many times it is repeated

// a depth-2 llll of bools, determining if a note of a chord is tied to the next note at that voice
ties: (int|int[])[]
// a single value is spread across all notes in a chord 
// nil values are set to 0, unless the pitch value is already also nil

// an llll of bools (technically integers equal to 0 or 1) that determines which elements are rests
rests: bool[];

// NOTE there is a bijective (?) map between the set of all duration sequences (ignoring rhythmic tree levels)
// and all unique combinations of (scale, contour, and rests).
// this means that when specifying a set of durations, all other parameters are generated automatically.

// total is the sum of the absolute value of each duration
total: rat 
// though a strictly analytic parameter, it is useful for displaying motives, generating score and querying
