// required is an llll of slots for each element, and each note in a non-rest element   
required: [int, any[]][][][]
// optional is an llll of breakpoints for each element, and each note in a non-rest element 
// the trivial breakpoint [0 0 0 velocity] is automatically added when compiling the motive
optional: [float, float, ?float, ?float][][][]
// the arguments are: 
// a normalized float, the relative x-position (time) between the element onset and offset,
// the change in cents of the element's pitch
// an optional snormalized float for the curve between this breakpoint and the previous
// an optional int (1-127), for a change in velocity. 
// slots_id is the index of a row in the Slots Tables, or 1 if only default slots (25-30) are used
