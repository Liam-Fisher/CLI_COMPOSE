The possible fields to be assigned to a newly defined articulation are the following ones:
– fullname: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "myfermata")
– shortname: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "myf")
– alias: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots
– font: a symbol containing the font name, or "default" (in order to use the defined "articulationsfont")
– basept: the basic font size (corresponding to a no-vzoom situation). 
– position: one of the following symbols: "abovenote", "belownote", "noteside", "stemsidenearnotehead", "stemsidenearflag", "manual", 
determining the position of the articulation

The following specifications determine the characters used:
– mainchar: symbol or unicode value determining the main articulation character (above notes)
– flippedchar: symbol or unicode value determining the flipped articulation character (below notes)
– extchar: symbol or unicode value of the articulation extension, if any (e.g.: the tilde in a trill line)

The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom:
– mainxshift, mainyshift: x and y shift of positioning for the main character (positive y shift moves up)
– flippedxshift, flippedyshift: x and y shift of positioning for the flipped character
– mainheight, flippedheight: height of the main and flipped characters
– mainycenter, flippedycenter: position of the vertical center of the articulation for main and flipped char
– outsidestaffynudge: additional y shift to push articulation farther from staff
– extyshift: horizontal offset for the beginning of the articulation extensions

Finally, one can assign an option specification, possibly followed by a list of symbols, to set some flags. 
Symbols must be among the following ones:
· avoidlines,: avoid staff lines
· outsidestaff,: always place outside staff
· centerovernote,: center over the notehead
· centeroverstem,: center over the stem
· spanties,: articulation extension spans sequences of tied notes
· copywhencloned,: copy articulation while copying notes
· copywhenclonedtosamechord,: ...also when copying notes into the same chord
· copywhensplit,: copy articulation to all notes when notes are split, or retranscribed as tied sequences
· shiftwithbeams,: shift vertically according to beams
 avoid lines,  outside staff,  center over note,  center over stem,  span ties,  copy when cloned,  copy when cloned to same chord,  copy when split,  shift with beams
