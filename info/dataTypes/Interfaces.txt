Data Categories: Parameter, Event, IndexMaps, Sequences, Maps, Spaces,  
parameter : numbers
Parameters are measurable data (such as numbers). They are grouped into events.



event : (Slot)
creating a single event, with defined parameters, at an undetermined time.
Events may possess relative time infomation, but are abstracted from absolute time, 
i.e. an envelope event, though having a defined adsr, does not specify at what
measure it occurs. 
 
IndexMaps : Contour
IndexMaps are sequences of measurable parameters,  


Sequence: Contour, Rhythm
Sequence UIs are for creating a sequence of abstract event Classes, i.e. (relative duration, interval)
sequences elements are more abstract than events, usually a single data type (rat, int, float),
and thus can be mapped into multiple forms (augmenting rhythms, transposing Contours, etc...) 


Spaces
Space UIs define a set of elements from which the abstract parameters of a sequences are drawn
Although unordered, they are indexed for practical purposes of memory access.
contour etc...

matrix  : 
Matrix UIs are use to concatenate multiple sequences or events into an aggregate form, where 
events occur simultaneously with different parameters.
