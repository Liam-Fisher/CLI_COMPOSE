// automated indicates whether the slotinfo is designed for a human performer
// this determines which default slots are included in the slotinfo 
automated: bool 

// dynamics, articulations, notehead,annotation and lyrics are already linked (if automated if false)
// in theory, an automated performanceStation does not benefit from any linkages, however, you may wish
// to assign them for display purposes. 
linkages: [int 'annotation'|'lyrics'|'dynamics'|'articulations'|'dlcolor'|
'notecolor'|'notesize'|'noteheadfont'|'noteheadadjust'|'notehead']

only 24 slots are availible to be assigned by the values in a Slotinfo Tables

slots 25-29 are assigned to one of two lllls, based on the rows "automated" value
(these are the global variables defaultSlotInfoA and defaultSlotInfoB in the enums file)

defaultSlotInfoA are the markings standard to music notation 
(dynamics, articulations, notehead,annotation and lyrics)

DefaultSlotInfoB:
/// /// these slots are fairly standard dsp fair 
the filter slot is a dynfilter that filters the output values for an associated dsp object groups output 
the pan slot pans the outputs of an associated dsp object groups outputs before recording or outputing sound.
the file slot is a filelist where each indexed file should be loaded asynchronously into the 
objects associated with that midichannel and those indices.

/// /// these slots are more complex, and represent an upper limit for the kind of things you should try and do
with slot outputs.

the parameters slot sends a message to a named max object, it is independent from its associated midichannel.
Use this over eval for time-sensitive but simple operations.  
the format is [<targetObject> <...message args>][] where targetObject is an object's scripting name. 

the eval slot contains a text string that is set as the expression for a bell.eval object, 
the bach.eval object is then triggered with the slots midichannel, which may or may not 
be used. This is intended for the purpose of setting a global variable whose bach.value object 
will auto-output its new value and trigger some kind of process. 


slot 30 is always the "GlobalTime" slot of type int (see info\misc\globalTimeSlot);
