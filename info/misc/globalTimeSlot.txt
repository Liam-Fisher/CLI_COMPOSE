slot 30 is always the "GlobalTime" int slot, which refers to the time (in milliseconds) 
that a note or rest "should" occur, counting from the start of the piece. 
This is set for the first element of the first voice every measure. 
It is assigned to automatically in the score by the "Measures" llll.
It can also be set with an additional argument to a "Measure" llll, or ignored for that measure,
by setting the final argument is nil.

The purpose of this slot is two-fold:

When only assigned automatically, it serves to adjust the play speed of a performers score, 
based on the local machine's current cpu time, and the agreed upon "PieceStartTime" variable,
which is broadcast to all performers upon joining. This is done by sending a smoothed signal 
of scaling to a "setclock" max object in "mult" mode, based on the ratio between the change in
globalTime and the change in localCPU time.

When assigned to manually (via an extra argument to a measure), it performs the same tempo smoothing,
but with the added purpose of aligning measures across multiple performanceStations. This could also be done
by precisely calculating tempo changes, and is primarily provided for convience.

The difference between the time calculated from measures and an assigned GlobalTime value is added to the 
global variable "GlobalTimeOffset", which is used to calculate future global times in the piece.

Although the GlobalTime can be set to any value, it is best used to tweak the automatically calculated value, 
and not as a general purpose tempo control device, since it is less efficient and less intuitive than setting
tempi in a measure.
