there are 10 copy codes in total, split into 5 lists (one for each component)
the first copy code for each list is whether or not the component will be copied for an extra voice
'copycodes'.'MS':1 means copy measures if there are more voices than sublists in MS_ids
'copycodes'.'RT':1 means copy rhythms if there are more voices than sublists in RT_ids
and so on...
the second copy code for PT, BP, and SL only is whether or not an elements is copied for extra durations
ex. if a voice has durations 1/4 1/4 1/4 and pitches [C5 G5] [C5 A5] 
then 'copycodes'.'PT':1 will append [C5 A5] to pitches (this is the default behaviour of bach.Score
else, durations will become rests
the third copy code for  BP, and SL only is whether or not an elements is copied for extra voices
ex. if a pitch in a sequence is [C5 E5 G5] and the slot is [ [[1 23] [2 24]] [[1 45][2 43]]] ]
then [[1 45][2 43]]] will be appended
