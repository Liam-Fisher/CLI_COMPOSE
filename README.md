CLI Compose is an application for the composition of musical scores using the bell language. 

You can create, combine and transform different elements of a score, such as dynamics, rhythm and pitches, stored in a localized sql database.

This is ideal for algorithmic/stochastic composition, as well as organizing and constructing musical motifs

It also features a handful of helpful displays and GUIs.
